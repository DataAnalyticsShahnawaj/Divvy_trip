## Analyze
==========

2. Make a copy of file and name it as analyze_data
3. Where relevant, making columns consistent .
4. Clean and transform the data to prepare for analysis.
5. Conduct descriptive analysis.

Options:
	* Calculate the mean of ride_length
	* Calculate the max ride_length
	* Calculate the mode of day_of_week
7. Create a pivot table to quickly calculate and visualize the data. 
Options:
	* Calculate the average ride_length for members and casual riders. 
	Try rows = member_casual; Values = Average of ride_length.
	* Calculate the average ride_length for users by day_of_week. 
	Try columns = member_casual; Rows = day_of_week; Values = Average of ride_length.
	* Calculate the number of rides for users by day_of_week by adding Count of trip_id to Values.

8. Save the file as analyze_data .
